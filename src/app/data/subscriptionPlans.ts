Washing centre mein ek shampoo wash ₹500–800 leta hai — hum subscription mein ₹53 per wash kar rahe hain, ghar par, roz.

Washing centre mein ek shampoo wash ₹500–800 leta hai — hum subscription mein ₹53 per wash kar rahe hain, ghar par, roz. With us, you get a WhatsApp before-and-after photo with timestamp every morning — that photo is your daily service proof.`,

Our plan is not about washing because the car is dirty — it is about not having to think about it at all. Same time every morning, same person, same result. Subscription is month-to-month — cancel anytime after the first month with 7 days' notice. Try it for one month and judge for yourself.`,
  willDamage:        `Great question — we use the gentlest method. Daily washing is always a plain water spray and microfibre dry — no chemicals on the paint every day. Express Wash includes one shampoo wash per month on the car body. Smart Wash upgrades that to fortnightly (2×/month). ELITE upgrades it further to weekly (4×/month). So the body only gets shampoo once a week at most — not daily.`,

  noContract:        `No long-term contract. Our subscription is month-to-month. You can cancel after the first month by giving 7 days' written notice via WhatsApp. The first month's payment is non-refundable once service has started — this covers washer assignment and scheduling. After the first month, there is no penalty for leaving.`,
  randomParking:     `We do need working space around the vehicle to wash it properly — our washer needs to move around all four sides. If your parking is not fixed, the vehicle needs to be parked in an accessible bay where the washer can work without obstruction. Our team will call you within 24 hours to check the location and confirm the slot.`,
